## Day 1 - Expanding Cards

This is my first day building projects with Github, I wrote this text by myself because I still learning English. <br />
In ths project you will find a simple example of HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I used flexbox, grid and simple javascript to do this, i hope that like you!
